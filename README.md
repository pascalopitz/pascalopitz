### Hi,

I'm [Pascal](http://www.pascalopitz.com). I'm a Software Developer based in Adelaide. My career in web development started in the days of table layouts, spacer pixels and hand optimised image maps. Today I am specialising in full stack JavaScript development.

In my spare time I ride a bike a lot and sometimes look after my pet projects, like the [Unofficial Sonos Controller for Linux](https://github.com/pascalopitz/unoffical-sonos-controller-for-linux).

Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascalopitz/) profile to find out more about my professional background.
