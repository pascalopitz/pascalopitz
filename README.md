### Hi,

I'm [Pascal](http://www.pascalopitz.com). I'm a Software Developer based in Adelaide. My career in web development started in the days of table layouts, spacer pixels and hand optimised image maps. Today I am specialising in full stack JavaScript development, usually with NodeJS and React in the mix.

My super power is jumping into an early stage project and putting in place all the things that are needed to grow to a stage where it can be run as a business, i.e. refactoring messy MVP code to follow a better structure, strong development practices and workflows, automated testing and deployment, technology choices and repeatable configuration and provisioning of cloud infrastructure.

I am especially interested in projects that involve an ethical value proposition or have a background in health or sports.

In my spare time I ride a bike a lot and sometimes look after my pet projects, like the [Unofficial Sonos Controller for Linux](https://github.com/pascalopitz/unoffical-sonos-controller-for-linux).

Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascalopitz/) profile to find out more about my professional background and get in touch to discuss your next project.
