### Hi,

I'm Pascal. I'm a freelance Software Developer based in Adelaide, specialising in full stack JavaScript development, usually with node.js and React in the mix.

My special talent is jumping into an early stage project and put in place all the things that are needed to grow to a stage where it can be run as a business, i.e. refactoring messy MVP code to follow a better structure, strong development practices and workflows, automatic testing and deployment, technology choices and repeatable configuration and provisioning of cloud infrastructure.

In my spare time I ride a bike a lot and sometimes look after my pet projects, like the [https://github.com/pascalopitz/unoffical-sonos-controller-for-linux](Unofficial Sonos Controller for Linux).

I am currently available for contracting and freelance work.
Find me on [LinkdIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascalopitz/) to find out more about my professional background and get in touch to discuss your next project.
